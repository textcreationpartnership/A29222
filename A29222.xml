            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>And then fell he upon his bended knees,</l>

                  <l>By that foul act, but yet whenas he ſaw</l>
                  <l>Th' event thereof, he then did ſtand in awe;</l>
                  <l>And gave again the Pieces, price of blood,</l>
                  <l>In hope thereby he might receive ſome good:</l>
                  <l>But his repentance 't (ſeemeth) came too late,</l>

                  <l>And then he call'd for <hi>Malchus</hi> to come neer,</l>

                  <l>His heart was alwayes bent to think upon,</l>

                  <l>To ſerve with zeal untill his dying day</l>
                  <l>Which as he did, good Lord grant that I may</l>
                  <l>But when at laſt he did his Maſter know,</l>
                  <l>His humble heart did then begin to bow,</l>
                  <l>And prayed that he might ſafely come to him,</l>
                  <l>To whom before he had vow'd every lim,</l>

                  <l>For by ſuch earthly helps there's many dies.</l>

                  <l>Without all fear of greateſt danger he,</l>
                  <l>Did boldly leap into the raging Sea,</l>

                  <l>As if it ment to ſwallow <hi>Peter</hi> in:</l>

                  <l>It was at firſt, and ſuch are creatures all</l>

                  <l>When friends did meet were wel content with bread,</l>
                  <l>With bread alone they're joviall and do ſing</l>
                  <l>The worthy praiſes of their heavenly king;</l>
                  <l>And then their drink was ſuiting to their meat</l>
                  <l>They had no change but all one kind did eat:</l>
                  <l>And yet their mirth above the skies did mount;</l>
                  <l>Altho their drink were water from the fount.</l>
                  <l>And afterwards I read, when friends did meet</l>
                  <l>With th'fatted Calf or Kid they kindly greet</l>
                  <l>One friend another and are well content</l>
                  <l>To ſing his praiſe who theſe great bleſſings ſent</l>
                  <l>In after times I ſee they eat good chear,</l>

                  <l>At <hi>Cana's</hi> mariage where no doubt was love,</l>
                  <l>And thereof doubtleſſe did their God approve,</l>

                  <l>They ſerved God altho they eat good chear;</l>
                  <l>But preſent times are truly ſaid none ſuch,</l>
                  <l>For that from theſe they differ more then much</l>
                  <l>For now tho ſometime we do make a feaſt,</l>
                  <l>Whereto we happily kill a little beaſt;</l>
                  <l>Perchance a fowl or ſome ſuch other thing,</l>

                  <l>Seeing our diſcourſe is moſt part idle chat,</l>
                  <l>Without ſo much as mention once of that</l>
                  <l>Whereon we alwayes ought to think upon,</l>
                  <l>Which is on Chriſt his bitter paſſion;</l>
                  <l>And ſuch feaſts now are ſeldome with us uſed,</l>
                  <l>But other feaſts where God is much abuſed:</l>
                  <l>Yet neither meat nor bread is there required,</l>
                  <l>But onely drink and drink alone deſired;</l>

                  <l>Good God that our feaſts ſhould thus differ far</l>
                  <l>Begin in freindſhip, yet to end in war:</l>

                  <l>We us'd to feaſt in Chriſtmaſs time ere while;</l>
